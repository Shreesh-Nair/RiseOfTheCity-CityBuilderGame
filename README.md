CityBuilder
Overview
CityBuilder is a casual, relaxing city-building simulation game designed for players to construct and manage a thriving city. With sandbox-style gameplay and simple progression mechanics, players can design their city layout, balance resources, and optimize growth while maintaining population morale.

Unity Version
This project is developed using Unity version 6000.0.32f1.

Features
Assets
The game utilizes the SimplePoly City - Low Poly Assets pack from the Unity Asset Store. Below are the key asset categories:

Buildings: Includes a wide variety such as Auto Service, Bakery, Bar, Factory, Residential Buildings (with color variations), Modern Houses (with texture variations), Stadium, Supermarket, and more.

Vehicles: Contains 42 prefabs with static and separated wheels (e.g., Trucks, Buses, Police Cars, Ambulances).

Nature: Includes trees, bushes, rocks, grass fences, pot bushes, and more.

Props: Bench types, billboards, bus stops, coffee shop chairs, dustbins, fences, hydrants, roof props (e.g., antennas), road props (e.g., streetlights), and more.

Roads: A tile-based road system for easy construction.

Game Description
Type: Single-player sandbox-style city-building simulation.

Core Concept: Players start with a small area and limited buildings. Progression unlocks new plots (industrial and agricultural zones), expands land availability, and introduces new goals.

Resource Management:

Agricultural zones produce food materials.

Industrial zones produce raw materials.

Players must balance food and raw material production to meet population needs.

Trade excess resources to avoid deficits or surpluses.

Gameplay Mechanics
Building Placement System
Grid-based placement ensures buildings fit predefined tiles.

Buildings require proximity to roads to function.

Some structures depend on nearby facilities (e.g., industrial buildings near factories).

Placement costs vary based on type and size.

Tile-Based Road System
Modular road construction allows players to connect their city piece by piece.

Traffic flow mechanics simulate congestion in high-density areas.

Future upgrades may include bridges and tunnels.

Economy & Trade System
Budget management involves taxes (fixed income tax + GDP-based tax).

Resource balance is critical:

Agricultural zones → Food materials.

Industrial zones → Raw materials.

Trading excess resources maintains balance.

Population Growth & Housing
Housing capacity determines the maximum population.

Immigration rate depends on morale, GDP, and population density.

Emigration occurs if morale drops too low.

Morale System
Factors affecting morale:

Pollution & Population Density: Parks help offset negative effects of high density.

Tax Rate Effect: Higher taxes reduce morale; lower taxes decrease income.

Greenery & Decorations: Trees and parks improve morale.

Service Buildings: Police stations, hospitals, and schools boost morale.

XP & Level Progression
Players earn XP by completing goals such as:

Reaching population milestones.

Constructing specific buildings or achieving GDP targets.
Progression unlocks:

New land plots (industrial/agricultural zones).

Additional building types and challenges.

Basic Traffic Simulation
Vehicles spawn randomly at one side of the city and disappear at the other using a waypoint system. This adds life to the city without complex AI.

Goals & Progression
Main Objective
Build a thriving city by:

Placing buildings strategically.

Managing roads effectively.

Increasing population and income while maintaining morale above a threshold.

Progression System
Players start at Level 1 with limited land and basic structures. As they level up:

More land becomes available for expansion.

New building types are unlocked.

Industrial and agricultural regions are introduced.

Societal Benefits
CityBuilder offers several benefits for players:

Encourages creativity through city design and optimization challenges.

Introduces basic resource management skills in an engaging way.

Provides a relaxing environment for experimentation without pressure or violence.

Teaches logical thinking through planning and balancing city needs.

Target Audience
CityBuilder is designed for:

All ages – Family-friendly gameplay with no violence or negative elements.

Casual gamers who enjoy sandbox-style simulation games.

Fans of city-building games seeking a simpler experience that is less time-consuming.
